# invest_with_intelligence

In this project, we aim to build a web-based application that predicts the Success of a startup or business using a machine learning model. The application will take inputs of startup features, and provide a prediction of the expected Growth. By automating the process of profit prediction, we can provide valuable insights to entrepreneurs and investors to make informed decisions about their investments. Our goal is to provide an end-to-end solution that includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment, with a focus on usability, reliability, and accuracy. 

>> Technologies Using in this Project:
    ReactJs For Frontend
    Spring For Backend
    My SQL For Database
    Flask for Machine Learning Model Integration.
